## Description

<p>Table: <code>Signups</code></p>

<pre>
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
user_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Table: <code>Confirmations</code></p>

<pre>
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
| action         | ENUM     |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key for this table.
user_id is a foreign key with a reference to the Signups table.
action is an ENUM of the type (&#39;confirmed&#39;, &#39;timeout&#39;)
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed (&#39;confirmed&#39;) or expired without confirming (&#39;timeout&#39;).</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to find the IDs of the users that requested a confirmation message <strong>twice</strong> within a 24-hour window. Two messages exactly 24 hours apart are considered to be within the window. The <code>action</code> does not affect the answer, only the request time.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>

| 7       | 2021-06-13 11:57:30 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-23 00:00:00 | timeout   |
| 6       | 2021-10-23 14:14:14 | confirmed |
| 6       | 2021-10-24 14:14:13 | timeout   |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 2       |
| 3       |
| 6       |
+---------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
User 2 requested two messages within exactly 24 hours of each other, so we include them.
User 3 requested two messages within 6 minutes and 59 seconds of each other, so we include them.
User 6 requested two messages within 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds of each other, so we include them.
User 7 requested two messages within 24 hours and 1 second of each other, so we exclude them from the answer.

### **SQL**

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT c1.user_id AS user_id
FROM
    Confirmations c1
INNER JOIN Confirmations c2
ON c1.user_id = c2.user_id
WHERE c1.time_stamp < c2.time_stamp
AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, c1.time_stamp, c2.time_stamp) <= 24 * 60 * 60;
```
